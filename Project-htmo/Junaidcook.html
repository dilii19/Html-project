     <li> Rinse and Parboil Rice:
    Rinse the rice in cold water until the water     
    runs clear. Parboil the rice for about 10 
    minutes until it's partially cooked. Drain and 
    set aside.
<br>
<li>Prepare the Sauce:</li>
<br>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a pot. Saut√© chopped 
    onions until translucent. Add minced garlic and    
    stir for a minute.</li>
<br>
<li>Add blended tomatoes and red bell pepper. Cook   
     until the mixture thickens and the oil begins 
     to separate.</li>
<br>
<li>Add Seasonings:</li>
<br>
<li>Stir in thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, salt,
    and pepper. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
<br>
<li>Cook the Rice:(let it cook)</li> 
<br>
<li>Add the partially cooked rice to the     
     tomato-pepper sauce. Stir well to coat the 
     rice with the sauce.</li>
<br>
<li>Add Broth/Water:</li>
<br>
<li>Pour in chicken or vegetable broth (or water).     
    The liquid should be about 1/2 inch above the 
    rice.</li>
<br>
<li>Simmer:</li>
<br>
<li>Reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer  
    until the rice is cooked and the liquid is 
    absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent  
    burning.</li>
<br>
<li>Check for Doneness:
<br>
    <li>Taste the rice to ensure it's fully cooked. 
    If needed, add more broth or water and continue 
    cooking.</li>
<br>
<li>Fluff and Garnish:
<br>
   Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork.            
   Garnish with chopped green bell pepper.
